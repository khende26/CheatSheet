    /*  VARIABLES are containers for storing data values
            example:   int numOne;                   int is the variable type, assigning a name is declaing the variable;
            example:  String name = "julie";         String is the variable type, declare the variable with the name and assign the variable by giving it the name julie.
            example:  int total = numOne+ numTwo;    this is called inline initialization (provided a type, declared with name of total and assigned
                                                     (other variables) all in one line.)

         METHODS    A method is a block of code which only runds when it is called.
                    You can pass data, known as parameters/arguments, into a method.
                    Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as funtions.
                    Why use methods? to reuse code: define the code once and use it many times.  (Call upon the method using setters/getters)
            example: public int addNumbers(int numOne, int numTwo) {
                          int total = numOne + numTwo;
                          return total;
            example defined:    public=access modifier / int = return type/ addNumbers = method name /int numOne int num Two are the parameters
                                    int total = numOne + numTwo; is the local variable  and is part of the method body.
                                    return total is the return statement.
            calling a method by usng  method name addNumbers(1,2) and adding numbers for the unknown variables.

       FOR LOOPS
            example  for/keyword/(int index = 0/initializer/; index <3/condition/; index++/incrementor/decrementor/) {
                      System.out.println(index)

       WHILE LOOPS
            example  int index = 0           known as the initializer
                     while (index <3)        known as the condition
                        System.out.println(index);  known as the body
                        i==                  known as the incrementor/decrementor

       IF AND IF ELSE
            example if(numOne >numTwo) {                     if is the keyword  (in parenthesis is the condition) {
                    System.out.println(numOne + "is greater than" + numTwo   and the body telling ti what to do.

            example  if(numOne >numTwo) {                     if is the keyword  (in parenthesis is the condition) {
                    System.out.println(numOne + "is greater than" + numTwo   and the body telling it what to do.
                    }else {
                    System.out.println(numOne + "is less than" + numTwo   again the else statement body telling it what to do.
